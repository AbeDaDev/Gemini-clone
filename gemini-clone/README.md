ü§ñ Gemini AI Clone

With the growing demand for AI technologies, I‚Äôve been eager to build and practice through hands-on projects. As part of my AI Engineering journey, I followed a tutorial to create a Gemini AI clone.

This project utilizes OpenAI‚Äôs API and demonstrates how to recreate a simplified version of Google‚Äôs Gemini AI. It gave me deeper insight into how AI models work behind the scenes and how user input is processed and transformed into meaningful responses. Exploring the internal workings of AI has been both educational and fascinating.

I‚Äôm excited to continue learning and building more AI-powered projects.
